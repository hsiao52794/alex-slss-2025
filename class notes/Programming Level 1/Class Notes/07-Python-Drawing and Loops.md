 ## Turtles!

 Turtle is a library that helps us visually interact with python code

To draw the screen we creat turtle. Turtes will be a new **type** of data

 ## Turtle Boilerplate

 **Boilerplate** is code that is frequently

 ```python
import turtle

wn = turtle.Screen()  # Set up the window and its attributes
wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")

# TMNT - turtles


wn.exitonclick()
```
## creating Turtles

> THe names of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles:
> Blue bandana - Leonardo (Leo)
> Red bandana - Raphael (Raph)
