### Getting the Type

We can use the `type()` function to get the type of a variable.

`type()` is a function, just like `print()` is a *function*.

*Values*, in Python can be grouped based on their type, also known as a **data type**.

We'll look at **data types** more specifically in the next section.

### Variables names

When naming our variables, we need to follow Python's rules.

So far, we've used two **types of data**.

`"Mr. Ubial"` is an example of a ~~put your answer here~~.

`32` is an example of a ~~put your answer here~~.

`32.2` is a number, but more specifically it's an example of a ~~put your answer here~~.

### F-String
This only exists in Python. the F in F-String stands for **format**.To create an f-string

```python
name = f"Mr.Ubial"
```

```python
friend_name = "Bro"
print(f"Hey {friends_name}!")
```

you can use `{}` in side of an f-string to evaluate an expression

## Input and output
Whenever we want to get information from the userr, we can use the `input()` function

```python
name = str(input(Whats's your name))
```
