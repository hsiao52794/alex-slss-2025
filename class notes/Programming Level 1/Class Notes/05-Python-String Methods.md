## `in` keyword --> `str`

If you want to see if a string contain some characters or if it contain a **substring** we can use the `in` keyword

```python
# ask the custom if they want fries
fries_reply = input("Do you want fries?") # "yes!"

if "yes" in fries_reply:
	print("Here are your fries.")
else
	print("you will no have fries.")
```
