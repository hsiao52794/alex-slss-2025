# Branching

23 September

## `if`

Branching is a concept in computer science that allows us to write code that has *two or more different outcomes*.


This is the "grammer"
```python
if <statement>:
	<code block - line 1>
	<...>
	<code block - line n>
```

Example:
```python
user_name = "Mr. Ubial"
if user_name = "Mr.Ubial":
	print("Access granted")
	print("you can see all the secret information")
```

**Booleans** are a type of data in Python.Booleans are binary and are either `True` or `False`
```python
is_sunny = True

is is_sunny

```
